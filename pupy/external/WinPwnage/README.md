The meaning of this repo is to study the techniques.

Techniques are found online, on different blogs and repos here on GitHub. I do not take credit for any of the findings, thanks to all the researchers.

Rewrote them and ported it to Python 2.7. The code under _todo_ folders are not tested, do not expect it to work. 

## UAC bypass techniques:
* UAC bypass using fodhelper
* UAC bypass using computerdefaults
* UAC bypass using slui
* UAC bypass using silentcleanup
* UAC bypass using compmgmtlauncher
* UAC bypass using sdclt (isolatedcommand)
* UAC bypass using sdclt (App Paths)
* UAC bypass using perfmon
* UAC bypass using eventviewer
* UAC bypass using sysprep (dll payload supported)
* UAC bypass using migwiz (dll payload supported)
* UAC bypass using mcx2prov (dll payload supported)
* UAC bypass using cliconfg (dll payload supported)
* UAC bypass using token manipulation
* UAC bypass using sdclt and Folder class
* UAC bypass using cmstp
* UAC bypass using .NET Code Profiler (dll payload supported)
* UAC bypass using mocking trusted directories (dll payload supported)

## Persistence techniques:
* Persistence using userinit key
* Persistence using image file execution option and magnifier
* Persistence using hkey_local_machine run key
* Persistence using hkey_current_user run key
* Persistence using schtask (SYSTEM privileges)
* Persistence using explorer dll hijack
* Persistence using mofcomp and mof file (SYSTEM privileges)
* Persistence using wmic (SYSTEM privileges)
* Persistence using startup files
* Persistence using Cortana App
* Persistence using People App
* Persistence using bitsadmin

## Elevation techniques:
* Elevate from administrator to NT AUTHORITY SYSTEM using handle inheritance
* Elevate from administrator to NT AUTHORITY SYSTEM using named pipe impersonation
* Elevate from administrator to NT AUTHORITY SYSTEM using token impersonation
* Elevate from administrator to NT AUTHORITY SYSTEM using schtasks (non interactive)
* Elevate from administrator to NT AUTHORITY SYSTEM using wmic (non interactive)

## Execution techniques:
* Execute payload by calling the RegisterOCX function in Advpack.dll
* Execute payload using appvlp binary
* Execute payload from bash.exe if linux subsystem is installed
* Execute payload using diskshadow.exe from a prepared diskshadow script
* Execute payload as a subprocess of Dxcap.exe
* Execute payload since there is a match for notepad.exe in the system directory
* Execute payload using ftp binary
* Execute payload by calling the RegisterOCX function in ieadvpack.dll
* Execute payload by calling OpenURL in ieframe.dll
* Execute payload using the Program Compatibility Assistant
* Execute payload by calling the LaunchApplication function
* Execute payload by calling OpenURL in shdocvw.dll
* Execute payload using sqltoolsps binary
* Execute payload by calling OpenURL in url.dll
* Execute payload as a subprocess of vsjitdebugger.exe
* Execute payload by calling RouteTheCall in zipfldr.dll

## Installing the Dependencies:
```pip install -r requirements.txt```

## Build:
In order for a successful build, install the py2exe (http://www.py2exe.org) module and use the provided build.py script to compile all the scripts in to a portable executable. On Windows 10, Access Denied errors can accure while compiling, rerun until success or elevate the prompt.
