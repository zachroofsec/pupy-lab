linux-exploit-suggester.sh v1.0 [2019-03-01]

o Added additional 'Tags' for multiple exploits based on:

  + verifications conducted by bcoles and his notes at: https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework/tree/master/modules/exploits/linux/local

  + https://github.com/lucyoa/kernel-exploits

o Added following '--checksec' mode improvements:

  + added checks for all exploitation prevention features recommended by
    KSPP Project (http://kernsec.org/wiki/index.php/Kernel_Self_Protection_Project/Recommended_Settings)

  + handling situation when no kernel config is present on checked system (putting state 'unknown'
    when existence/enablement of the feature can't be determined)

  + support for features that have more then two states possible (e.g. CONFIG_SECCOMP)

o Sorting exploits functionality added. Sorting is done by dynamically calculated rank.
  Now most relevant exploits are listed and the top of the listing.
